## Method

### Prep/marinate

* Mix all the ground spices in a small bowl.
* Marinate the lamb with
  * **half** of this spice mix
  * {% tooltip 'yoghurt', 70, 'g' %} (or lemon juice)
  * **half** of the ginger paste ({% controlled 0.5 %}tbsp)
  * **half** of the garlic paste ({% controlled 0.5 %}tbsp)
  * {% tooltip 'salt', 2, 'tsp' %}
  * {% tooltip 'kasuri methi', 0.5, 'tbsp' %}
* Cover and set aside for at least 2 hours, or overnight in the fridge. This can be in the slow cooker if easiest.

### Cook whole spices and start lamb

* Heat a 1 or 2 tablespoons of oil in the slow cooker on 'fry' setting (or a pan if the lamb was marinating in the slow cooker) and add the whole spices: star anise, bay leaf, black cardamom, green cardamom & cinnamon.
* Once the spices begin to sizzle, add the mint leaves and immediately stir in the marinated lamb and cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes.
* Pour enough hot water to nearly cover the lamb and mix well. Cover and start cooking on high while you prep the tomato/onion mix below.
  * *This can cook like this for about an hour if you want to delay the next step at all, or proceed straight away.*

### Make the curry sauce

* In another pan, heat the rest of the oil. Add the onions and
  green chilies. Saute until deep golden but not burnt.
* Add the rest of the ginger and garlic ({% controlled 0.5 %}tbsp) of each & saute for another minute.
* Turn off the heat and stir in the rest of the ground spices, and the chopped tomatoes. Cook for a few minutes (min 5, max 20).

### Combine

* Transfer this to the lamb in the slow cooker. Cook covered on 'low' for 6 - 8 hours. Check the liquid level is about right - if it needs more water add some now. It won't reduce much in the slow cooker.
* If wanted, add chopped spinach at some point.

* Serve with rice or naan and chopped coriander.
