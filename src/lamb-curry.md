* Add all the ground spices to a small bowl and mix them.
* Marinate
   lamb with half of this spice mix, half of the ginger garlic, salt, 
  kasuri methi and yogurt (or lemon juice/ vinegar). Cover and set aside 
  for about 2 hours to overnight in the refrigerator.
* Heat
   1 to 2 tablespoon oil/ghee in a heavy bottom pan and add star anise, 
  bay leaf, black cardamom, green cardamom & cinnamon.
* Once
   the spices begin to sizzle, add the mint leaves and stir in the 
  marinated lamb and braise on a medium heat for about 8 to 10 minutes. 
* Pour
   half of the hot water and mix well. Cover and let cook on a low to 
  medium heat for 1 hour. Keep stirring every 15 mins and add more hot 
  water as you cook.

#### How to make Indian Lamb Curry

* Meanwhile
   in another pan, heat the rest of the oil/ghee. Add the onions & 
  green chilies. Saute on a medium heat for 6 to 7 mins.
* Reduce the heat and stir fry for a few more minutes until deep golden but not burnt.
* Add rest of the ginger garlic  & saute until the raw smell of ginger garlic goes away. This takes 1 to 2 minutes.
* Turn
   off the heat & stir in the rest of the ground spices, immediately 
  pour the tomato puree. Cook on a medium heat until the raw flavor of 
  tomatoes is gone.
* Transfer
   this to the lamb after 1 hour of cooking lamb. Cook covered on a low 
  heat until the meat is fully cooked and fork tender, for another 50 mins
   or more. Pour more hot water if required as you cook & keep 
  stirring often, every 5 to 7 mins.
* Taste
   test and add more salt or garam masala & kasuri methi if needed. If
   you want more heat in your lamb curry, add some freshly crushed black 
  pepper.
* Garnish lamb curry with coriander leaves and serve with roti/ naan/ rice or with any artisan bread.
* Lamb
   curry tastes best after resting for a few hours or even the next day. 
  Reheat & adjust the salt when you are ready to serve.
