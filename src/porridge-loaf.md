## Ingredients

Makes 1 loaf

* 250g natural yoghurt
* 1 medium egg
* 150g porridge oats
* 100g mixed dried fruit, larger fruits roughly chopped
* 100g mixed seeds, such as pumpkin, sunfiower, poppy, linseed, or buckwheat, plus an extra small handful to finish 50g nuts, such as walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds or cashews, roughly chopped
* 1 tsp caraway seeds (optional)
* 50ml milk
* ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
* ½ tsp flaky sea salt

## Method

Preheat the oven to 190°C/170°C Fan/Gas 5. Line a small (500g / 1lb) loaf tin with baking paper.

In a large bowl, whisk the yoghurt and egg together until smoothly combined. Stir in all the remaining ingredients until evenly mixed to give a creamy mixture, the texture of a thick porridge.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared loaf tin and level the surface using the back of the spoon. Scatter a handful of extra seeds evenly over the top.

Place on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes until a deep golden brown.

Allow the loaf to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely before slicing.
