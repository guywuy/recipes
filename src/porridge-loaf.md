## Ingredients

Makes 1 loaf

* 250g natural yoghurt
* 1 medium egg
* 150g porridge oats
* 100g mixed dried fruit, larger fruits roughly chopped
* 100g mixed seeds, such as pumpkin, sunfiower, poppy, linseed, or buckwheat, plus an extra small handful to finish 50g nuts, such as walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds or cashews, roughly chopped
* 1 tsp caraway seeds (optional)
* 50ml milk
* ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
* ½ tsp flaky sea salt

## Method

Preheat the fan or halogen oven to 170°C. Line a small (500g / 1lb) loaf tin with baking paper.

In a large bowl, whisk the yoghurt and egg together until smoothly combined. Stir in all the remaining ingredients until evenly mixed to give a creamy mixture, the texture of a thick porridge.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared loaf tin and level the surface using the back of the spoon. Scatter a handful of extra seeds evenly over the top.

Place on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes until a deep golden brown. (If using halogen oven, cover with foil for most of the time to prevent the top from cooking too quickly).

Allow the loaf to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely before slicing.

## Notes

Can be frozen or eaten fresh (or toasted if it dries out a bit).

This is a one-bowl, no-knead, fruity, nutty bread that is easy to make. You can use any mix of dried fruit, nuts and seeds that you happen to have in the kitchen - sultanas, raisins, dried apples, dried apricots, dried figs etc - or just nuts and seeds if you want a more savoury loaf.

Nice on it's own, or with honey, or cheese, or other foods.
