    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>To remove any bugsies or maggots from the sloes after picking them, you can soak them for a few hours in a large bowl full of water and a little bit of salt. The maggots will crawl out of the berries and float.<li>
        <li>If you wash and freeze the sloes, you can make it at your leisure. ( If you freeze them on a flat tray, they shouldn't stick together so much )</li>
    </ul>
