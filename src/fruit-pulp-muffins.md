## Method

- Preheat and prep: Preheat oven to 190¬∞C. Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it well.
- Mix dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
- Mix wet ingredients: In a separate medium-sized bowl, mix the juice pulp, brown sugar, milk, oil, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined.
- Combine wet and dry: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir with a spatula until just combined. Be careful not to overmix ‚Äî a few lumps are okay. If you're adding nuts or dried fruit, gently fold them in now.
- Fill and bake: Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about three-quarters of the way.
- Bake: Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
- Cool: Let the muffins cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes

- Pulp consistency: The moisture content of the pulp can vary. If the batter seems too thick, you can add a splash more milk. If it seems too wet, add a tablespoon or two of flour.
- Sweetness: Taste your pulp before adding the sugar. Beetroot and apple are naturally sweet, so you might be able to reduce the amount of sugar you add.
