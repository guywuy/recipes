## Method

* Preheat the oven to 150Â°C fan, or get the slow cooker ready.
* Put the {% tooltip 'oil', 200, 'ml' %}, chickpeas, whole garlic cloves, ginger, tomatoes, chillies, {% tooltip 'tomato paste', 1, 'tbsp' %}, spices, {% tooltip 'sugar', 1, 'tsp' %}, and {% tooltip 'salt', 1, 'tsp' %} into the slow cooker or a large pan, for which you have a lid, and mix everything together to combine.
* Cover with the lid, and either transfer to the oven to cook for 75 minutes, stirring halfway through, or set slow cooker to high and cook for at least 5 hours, until the aromatics have softened and the tomatoes have nicely broken down.
* Meanwhile (before serving), put the {% tooltip 'yoghurt', 180, 'g' %}, {% tooltip 'mint', 15, 'g' %}, {% tooltip 'fresh coriander', 30, 'g' %}, {% tooltip 'lime juice', 1, 'tbsp' %}, {% tooltip 'crushed garlic', 1, 'clove(s)' %} and {% controlled 0.5 %} tsp salt into a food processor and blitz until smooth and the herbs are finely chopped.
* Serve the chickpeas directly from the pan, with the yoghurt and lime wedges alongside.

## Notes

Slow-cooking the chickpeas in oil without added liquid (a confit) makes them super soft, allowing all the aromatics to break down into the oil. This dish can easily be made ahead and served later; it only improves with time.
Swap out Greek yoghurt with a non-dairy alternative for a completely vegan meal, and serve with rice.
