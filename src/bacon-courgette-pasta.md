* In the same pan, fry the courgette and garlic for about 6 - 8 mins, until lightly golden and most of the water has evaporated.
* Add the {% tooltip 'pasta', 150, 'g' %} and {% tooltip 'water', 400, 'ml' %}, stir and cook uncovered for 7 - 9 mins, until al dente, stirring frequently.
* Add the capers, lemon juice and zest, cheese and bacon. Add a bit more water if it looks dry.
* Stir and cook for up to a minute while the cheese begins to melt, then stir in the rocket until it wilts, and serve.

## Notes

Could work well with sweetcorn or other veg, and potentially olives instead of capers.
